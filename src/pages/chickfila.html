            <p>While I was the Senior Art Director at BrightWave, my main client was Chick-fil-A. I worked closely with the strategy team to develop 3 to 4 email campaigns every quarter. We were asked to introduce the Chick-fil-A app. We were able to deliver a new direction that was on brand, introduce the mobile app, and exceed the projected click through rate for the campaign. I developed the art direction, handled the design execution, and coded the HTML template.</p>
