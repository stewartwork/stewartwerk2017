            <p>We approached Mizuno about updating their email to a responsive template. Their existing one was a little dated and designed specifically for a desktop presentation. We worked up wireframes for the mobile and desktop. We decided to go with static wireframes since the HTML build is quite complex.</p>

            <p>After we got approval for the wireframes, I designed and built out the rest of the template. We had a lot of fun getting the hamburger menu to work, but after a few long nights and a couple calls to Silverpop we had a fully responsive, completely editable template. We built all the buttons as HTML and was built using percentages â€“ so we could get it to play nice in gmail.
