            <p>The Intouch Ministries project was one of my favorites during my second run at Deepblue. The project was a RWD UX consultation that included wireframes for their internal design team. We were under a tight timeline and we wanted to get into HTML as soon as possible. We presented ITM with the idea of HTML wireframes and they were open to it. We decided to use the Foundation framework for the wireframes and it was perfect for the job.</p>

            <p>Using HTML for the wires increased the clients ability to understand what they were seeing and cut our approval time in half. The ITM team was so happy with the results they asked us to present a mock up for the UI. They eventually decided to use the internal teams Art Direction but it was still an great process and I feel like there was some amazing work done by our team.</p>
