                <br>Sr. Art Director | Front-end Developer</p>

            <p>Brightwave is one of the largest independent email marketing agencies in the country and the work that they do is inspiring. I was presented with the opportunity to join the Brightwave team in a leadership role during the summer of 2014. Having an interest in email design and following Brightwave for a long time, I jumped at the chance.</p>

            <p>I joined the team as the Senior Art Director – leading a group of fantastic designers and front-end developers. My role expanded to Creative Director almost immediately, when the Creative Director took time off for maternity leave.</p>

            <p>Working directly with our clients, in-house, and third party strategy leads – we delivered award winning campaigns that surpassed the campaign teams quarterly estimates. It was one of the best working experiences of my career and I learned about the unique complexities of email development, email marketing, and various email service providers.</p>

                <br>Creative Director | Front-end Developer</p>

            <p>I was approached about returning to DeepBlue as the Creative Director in 2013. We had talked about returning the year before, I was extremely interested but it just wasn't possible at the time. Coming back to DeepBlue was a serious home-coming. This was the company that kick-started my career in web design and it was great to re-join the team.</p>

            <p>As the Creative Director, I worked directly with our clients and lead the design and front-end development teams. I was responsible for HR, PM, CRM, UX, wireframes, UI, creative reviews, task assignment, client workshops, and design / development deadlines. It was an extensive list of responsibilities and I learned more about running an agency in the year that I was at DeepBlue than at any other time in my career.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.groupcse.com/" target="_blank"><strong>CSE</a></strong>
                <br>Freelance Art Director</p>

            <p>I was brought in to CSE as an Art Director for a single project, this turned into several more after the success of the initial one. I was the Art Director for two of the largest projects CSE had won to that date.</p>

            <p>The initial project was Coke Zero's 2013 Bracket Challenge. I was asked to develop Art Direction and UI for the desk and mobile experiences. I worked closely with the SVP of creative, the KOZ team, Droga 5, and IBM to deploy the game on time and on budget. </p>

            <p>After the successful launch of the Coke Zero campaign, I was asked to stay on to supply design for several small projects and Art Direction and UI for the largest site development CSE had worked on at the time.</p>

            <p>CSE won the Kellogg Careers responsive site design. This was Kellogg's first responsive site development and an extremely important project for CSE. It was also the first completely in-house project of this size for CSE. As Art Director I worked closely with the UX, Project Management, Account, and Development teams. It was a large team with multiple leads.</p>

            <p>Working from the wireframes and Kellogg brand guidelines I developed the look and feel for the project and after multiple revisions, I developed a HTML prototype to showcase the mobile presentation. This was a massive project and presented many learning opportunities. It was a very satisfying project to be a part of.</p>

                <br>Freelance UI Designer | Front-End Developer</p>

            <p>I was contracted by Cheri Media to join the team that was going to redesign, code, and move HipHopDX over to Wordpress. HipHopDx is the third largest Hip Hop site online – with 10 years worth of articles, multiple editors, and an outdated CMS. I was part of a three man team – design / front-end (me), a wordpress guru, and the Creative Director / front-end . It was a lot of work, I made some lasting friendships, and it was probably the most fun I have had working on a project.</p>

            <p>We worked out of Ignition Alley in Atlanta which was a great time and pretty tricky. Transferring a database the size of HipHopDx would be tough with a fast connection, so working with IA's wonky wifi was a nightmare.</p>

            <p>Since it was such a small team we all had to be multi-disciplined. The designers were coders and UX, the wordpress dev supplied UX and design. We designed infographics, rating systems, multiple landing page and article layouts.</p>

            <p>Once the design / front-end portion of the project had been finalized I moved over to my next contract position and looked forward to the sites launch. The site took a couple of years to be updated and the full design was never actually implemented. It looks great and hopefully they will be releasing the full site design in the future.</p>

                <br>UI Designer | Front-end Developer</p>

            <p>I started at Nebo when it was still Neboweb. It is the longest tenure of my career and was an amazing place to work. I learned so much during my time there and it passed by in a flash.</p>

            <p>I have watched them grow from a one room / twelve person office to the mighty force they are today. I came in as a junior designer and left with a professional level skill-set and a portfolio of work that I was proud of. I made my bones there.</p>

            <p>I was asked to do it all and to learn fast. This was a time when everyone was a unicorn and wireframes were something you used to make paper mache dolls. No bootstrap, no foundation, I hand-coded from the doctype down. Sass wasn't even a thing. We had no frameworks, no js libraries – just a text-editor and a PSD. I made pixel perfect designs that I coded into exact replicas. I had a lot of failures and a lot of victories. I never did get that PHP thing down but I learned a lot of other stuff. It was a great job.</p>

            <p>Did a month contract position with Think Inc. It was great to get a new perspective and deal with a great CD.</p>

                <br>UI Designer | Front-end Developer</p>

            <p>I moved to Atlanta in 2005 after spending a few years as a print designer in Tennessee. I hated print. The massive file sizes and pre-press processing killed any desire to be a print designer. </p>

            <p>When I started at DeepBlue I knew nothing about the web design industry. I had the very basics of HTML, a BFA, and a serious desire to learn the business. I worked my way up from individually coloring 6,000 dresses in photoshop to presenting full site mock ups. I went from design view dreamweaver table based layouts to hand coding in divs. I learned CSS, Flash, Photoshop, and whatever else was needed at the time. It was a painful experience that still haunts me to this day. It was also the most valuable two years of my career. I returned 6 years later to become the Creative Director.</p>
